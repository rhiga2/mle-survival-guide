# Probability Spaces

# Random Variables
* A random variable is a function mapping the sample space to a number. 
* If set of values $X$ can take on is countable, $X$ is discrete. Otherwise, continuous.
* We can assign a probability to some value of $X$ if $X$ is discrete. If $X$ is continuous, we can only assign a probability that $X$ falls in set.

## Probability Mass Function (PMF)
## Probability Density Function (PDF)
## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
* CDF defines the how likely $X$ is less than some value.
$$
\begin{gathered}
F_X(x) = P(X < x) \\
F_X(x) = \sum_{k = \infty}^x f_X(x)
\end{gathered}
