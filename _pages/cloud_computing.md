# Cloudonomics
* On demand cost: pay for what you use.
* More economical to use cloud if (average demand) * (cloud cost) < (peak demand) * (owning cost)
* Utility premium is cost ratio between renting versus buying (cloud cost / owning cost).
* Thus utility premium must be less than the ratio of peak demand over average demand.
